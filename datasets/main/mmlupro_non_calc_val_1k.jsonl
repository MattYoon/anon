{"question":"Topic: law.\nQuestion: A large privately owned and operated shopping mall is open to the public and includes small shops, major department stores, and restaurants that are located around a pedestrian area. It also has several movie theaters, an ice-skating rink, a small amusement park, and a branch of the local public library. The mall is advertised as \"a small town with a big-town feel.\" During shopping hours, a group of 10 protesters gathered in the pedestrian area near the entrance to a department store to denounce the sale of animal fur products in that store. The protesters were peaceful and did not interfere with traffic into or out of the store, but they carried signs and vocally communicated their message to people walking in the area. Mall management quickly broke up the protest and required the protesters to leave the mall. The protesters have sued the mall, claiming that their right to freedom of speech guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments was violated. Should the protesters prevail?\nA) No, because the prohibition of protests adjacent to the entrance of a department store during shopping hours is a constitutionally proper limitation on the time, place, and manner of speech.\nB) No, because the mall has the right to control any activities that could negatively impact its business or patrons.\nC) Yes, because the protesters were peaceful and not interfering with the operation of the store.\nD) Yes, because the mall's advertisement as \"a small town with a big-town feel\" implies a public space where freedom of speech should be respected.\nE) Yes, because the mall is a public space and therefore must allow freedom of speech.\nF) Yes, because the mall is functionally equivalent to a town and, therefore, its actions are subject to the Constitution's guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly.\nG) No, because the mall is private property, and there was no state action to which the freedom of speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments apply.\nH) Yes, because the mall's restriction on the protesters' speech was broader than necessary to ensure proper access to the department store.\nI) No, because the mall has the right to maintain a certain atmosphere for its customers, free from protests and demonstrations.\nJ) No, because the protesters were causing a disturbance and potentially damaging the mall's business.","answers":["G","No, because the mall is private property, and there was no state action to which the freedom of speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments apply.","G) No, because the mall is private property, and there was no state action to which the freedom of speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments apply."]}

{"question":"Topic: law.\nQuestion: A prisoner was serving a life sentence in a state prison as a result of his conviction for the murder of a child who had trespassed onto his farmland. The prisoner came from a family of farmers, dating back to at least 1750. His family believed that all nourishment comes from the ground and that one's soul will be saved only if his diet consists totally of natural, farm-grown food.

As the man approached a railroad crossing he noticed that the barriers to the crossing were open. The man cautiously looked both ways for any train.

{"question":"Topic: law.\nQuestion: A law in one state forbids the transportation or sale of tomatoes in the state that have a more than 10% \"genetic engineering factor.\" The U.S. Department of Agriculture does not use or mention genetic engineering factors in its standards for the sale and transportation of tomatoes. Tomato growers in a second state wish to ship tomatoes for sale into the first state but its tomatoes are in compliance only with the federal standards. The tomato growers' association in the second state brought an injunctive action in federal court against the agricultural department of the first state to enjoin enforcement of the genetic engineering rule on the basis of federal preemption. According to U.S. Supreme Court precedent, how will the courts decide the preemption claim?\nA) There is no preemption because the first state's law does not contradict the federal law and both laws could be complied with simultaneously.\nB) When it comes to fresh produce, federal laws will always preempt state laws, and the injunction will be granted for that reason.\nC) The injunction will be granted because tomatoes that are in compliance with federal law never have to be approved also under a state law.\nD) Preemption does not apply here because agricultural regulations are generally left to the states.\nE) The first state's law sets standards that interfere impermissibly with the second state's law and therefore the first state's law is preempted.\nF) The injunction will be granted because the first state's law contradicts the intent of Congress in setting uniform national standards.\nG) The injunction will be granted because the federal law implicitly preempts any state law on the same subject matter.\nH) The injunction will be granted because the first state's law is violating the Commerce Clause by affecting interstate commerce.\nI) There is preemption because the first state's law is more stringent than federal law and therefore it cannot coexist.\nJ) The injunction will not be granted because the first state's law is a legitimate exercise of its police powers to protect public health.","answers":["A","There is no preemption because the first state's law does not contradict the federal law and both laws could be complied with simultaneously.","A) There is no preemption because the first state's law does not contradict the federal law and both laws could be complied with simultaneously."]}

{"question":"Topic: law.\nQuestion: A person owned property next to a highway. After raking leaves on his property into a large pile, the landowner loaded the leaves into several large metal barrels so that he could burn the leaves. Before starting the fire, the landowner telephoned the local weather bureau to determine which direction the wind would be blowing. Because a highway was located on the southern edge of his property, he was aware that it would be unsafe to burn the leaves if the wind was blowing in that direction. The weather bureau, however, indicated that the wind would be gusting in a northerly direction. Shortly after the landowner set the leaves on fire, the wind current unexpectedly shifted and started gusting in a southerly direction. As a consequence, the smoke and ashes blew over the highway, resulting in poor visibility. Moments later, a motorist was driving his automobile on the highway in a westerly direction. The posted speed limit was 45 m. p. h. , although the driver was traveling about 55 m. p. h. The driver could not see the highway clearly and crashed his vehicle into a median strip.

An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price.

{"question":"Topic: law.\nQuestion: A man owned land along the south side of a highway. To the south of the man's land was a lot owned by a woman who lived on it in a house. Five years ago the man conveyed a right-of-way easement over his land to the woman because it provided a more direct route between her house and the highway. The easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path. The document granting the easement was promptly recorded. Three years ago, the woman conveyed her house to the man. The man never took actual possession of the house. Two years ago, the man conveyed the house to a purchaser by a warranty deed. Two months after the purchaser moved into the house, a neighbor informed him about the easement. He then began using the path that had been marked on the man's land. When the man noticed the purchaser using the path, he erected a barricade on his land that effectively prevented the purchaser from using the path. The purchaser has sued the man, claiming that he has an easement over the man's land. Who is likely to prevail?\nA) The man, because the easement was extinguished.\nB) The man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition.\nC) The purchaser, because he purchased the house by warranty deed.\nD) The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.","answers":["A","The man, because the easement was extinguished.","A) The man, because the easement was extinguished."]}

A group of adjoining landowners who owned single-family residences sued for an injunction, alleging various environmental violations. The developer did not have a significant investment at that point, and decided to stop the construction.Shortly thereafter, the city passed a comprehensive new citywide zoning law that re-zoned the subject property and some large tracts of adjoining land to low-density residential, allowing one residence for each 4.6 acres. This destroyed the multi-unit plan and the city cancelled the permit, which the developer did not appeal.The developer's land value decreased from $2 million to $100,000.The developer sued the city in federal court on the basis that this was illegal spot zoning constituting a taking in violation of due process.Will the developer prevail with his federal constitutional claim?\nA) Yes, the city cannot change zoning laws after issuing a building permit without compensating the developer.\nB) No, the developer was aware of potential zoning changes and should have taken that into consideration.\nC) No, the developer should have made a significant investment and appealed the city's decision.\nD) Yes, because he got a building permit and justifiably relied on that approval  the rezoning was an illegal act once it granted a building permit.\nE) Yes, the developer had a right to construct the planned units as per the original permit.\nF) Yes, because the new zoning law disproportionately affected the developer compared to other landowners.\nG) No, the city has the right to rezone land for the greater good of the community.\nH) Yes, because the developer's loss was caused by discriminatory spot zoning that took its property without due process.\nI) Yes, the state cannot cause such a dramatic diminution in an owner's property without paying just compensation.\nJ) No, this was a comprehensive new zoning plan that rezoned the entire city; the developer shared the loss with the adjoining owners who were also rezoned.","answers":["J","No, this was a comprehensive new zoning plan that rezoned the entire city; the developer shared the loss with the adjoining owners who were also rezoned.","J) No, this was a comprehensive new zoning plan that rezoned the entire city; the developer shared the loss with the adjoining owners who were also rezoned."]}
