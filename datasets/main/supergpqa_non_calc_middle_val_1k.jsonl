{"question":"Topic: French Language and Literature.\nQuestion: En Chine, lorsque l'on sort une carte de crédit pour régler une addition, on passe pour un dinosaure. Les clients locaux, qu'ils soient jeunes ou vieux, se servent de leur smartphone équipé de l'une des applications comme WePay (Tencent) ou Alipay (Alibaba). Ce pays gourmand d'innovations ne va pas en rester là. Il se convertit déjà au prochain saut technologique : l'équipement des caisses des magasins avec des systèmes de reconnaissance faciale. En France, selon notre enquête, le cash ne semble pas près de disparaître. Mais, avec la crise du Covid-19, l'essor du paiement sans contact s'est accéléré. Ira-t-on jusqu'à payer, comme les Chinois, avec nos téléphones mobiles ? Le succès rapide de la start-up LYDIA auprès des moins de 30 ans le laisse penser. Sans doute plus conservatrices sur ce sujet, les grandes banques françaises font le pari que la carte de crédit, invention française, restera le moyen de paiement dominant. Le match est lancé.\nLYDIA ne connaît pas la crise : en l'espace d'un an, l'application de paiement mobile a réussi à attirer 1,5 million de nouveaux clients pour atteindre 4,3 millions d'utilisateurs en France. Un record dans le milieu de la fintech (« finance » et « technologie ») ! D'après Cyril Chiche, qui a cofondé cette application en septembre 2011, sa start-up est devenue une entreprise de 120 salariés. 60 ont été embauchés en 2020 et une centaine devraient venir grossir ses rangs en 2021.\nLa raison du succès tient essentiellement en la modification des habitudes de paiement des Français en cette année si particulière. Depuis le printemps 2020, la petite monnaie et les espèces, soupçonnées de véhiculer le virus, ont été abandonnées. Conséquence : les volumes de transactions par cartes bancaires de LYDIA ont doublé. Pour régler des achats sur Internet, la start-up propose des cartes éphémères pilotables à partir de son téléphone grâce à l'application.\nMieux, en un an, la start-up française a remporté deux autres paris : compléter la levée de fonds de 40 millions d'euros réalisée en début d'année pour la porter à 112 millions d'euros et toucher une clientèle de plus en plus âgée.\nLargement préférée par les 18-20 ans addicts à leurs téléphones portables et au paiement sans contact, l'application de paiement mobile gagne aujourd'hui massivement les 25-30 ans, et même au-delà. « L'application est très pratique pour faire des virements instantanés et dans l'urgence à ses enfants », confirme Béatrice, cadre de cinquante ans.\nValentin, cadre dans l'immobilier, s'est aussi laissé séduire par la possibilité de souscrire en trois clics un crédit consommation allant de 500 € à 3 000 €, avec un remboursement sur 6 à 36 mois. Une option disponible depuis le mois de juillet sur l'application. Prudence toutefois car si des sommes importantes peuvent être débloquées en quelques secondes, il faut des mois pour les rembourser...\nSur la base du texte ci-dessus, répondez aux questions suivantes.Laquelle des affirmations suivantes est vraie ?\nA) LYDIA has obtained capital funding of 140 million euros\nB) LYDIA a réussi à lever des fonds de 152 millions d'euros.\nC) LYDIA has secured funding of 185 million euros\nD) LYDIA gathered investment funds of 145 million euros\nE) LYDIA achieved total funding of 160 million euros\nF) LYDIA accumulated funding worth 165 million euros\nG) LYDIA managed to raise capital of 175 million euros\nH) LYDIA reached total investments of 130 million euros\nI) LYDIA propose depuis juillet 2021 un nouveau service : un crédit consommation allant de 500 € à 3 000 €, avec un remboursement sur 6 à 36 mois.\nJ) LYDIA compte 180 salariés en 2021.","answers":["B","LYDIA a réussi à lever des fonds de 152 millions d'euros.","B) LYDIA a réussi à lever des fonds de 152 millions d'euros."]}

{"question":"Topic: Religious Studies.\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about Jainism is false? You need to include all the wrong options.I. It originated in Northern India and spread from there to the south, but how it began is unclear. Its founder is often, inaccurately, identified as the sage Vardhamana (better known as Mahavira, l. c. 599-527 BCE), but he is actually only the 25th tirthankara (\"ford builder\") of Jainism.II. Mahavira's development of the faith was in response to a general movement in India in the 8th and 4th centuries BCE of religious reform in response to Hinduism, the dominant faith at that time, which some thinkers felt was out of touch with the people's spiritual and physical needs.III. Jainism is one of the oldest religions in the world. The name comes from jiva (soul or life force but, capitalized, is also given as Spiritual Conqueror) as it maintains that all living things possess an immortal soul which has always and will always exist and this soul may be liberated from suffering by adhering to Jain tenets.IV. The precepts of Jainism, it is claimed, are eternal; they were never initiated by any mortal but only \"received\" by the 25 enlightened sages who transmitted them to others. As noted, this is the same claim made by Hindus regarding the Vedas.V.

{"question":"Topic: Religious Studies.\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about Shinto is false? You need to include all the wrong options.\nI. Unlike many other religions, Shinto has no recognised founder. The peoples of ancient Japan had long held animistic beliefs, worshipped divine ancestors and communicated with the spirit world via shamans; some elements of these beliefs were incorporated into the first recognised religion practised in Japan, Shinto, which began during the period of the Yayoi culture (c. 300 BCE - 300 CE).\nII. Two chronicles, commissioned by the imperial house (Emperor Temmu), are invaluable sources on Shinto mythology and beliefs. The Kojiki ('Record of Ancient Things') was compiled in 750 CE by the court scholar Ono Yasumaro, who drew on earlier sources, mostly genealogies of powerful clans. Then the Nihon Shoki ('Chronicle of Japan' and also known as the Nihongi), written by a committee of court scholars, came in 749 CE which sought to redress the bias many clans thought the earlier work had given to the Yamato clan.\nIII. As described below, the Shinto and Buddhist faiths became closely intertwined in ancient Japan, and as a consequence, some Buddhist figures, the bosatsu or 'enlightened beings,' became popular kami with practitioners of Shinto.\nIV. As with many other ancient religions, the Shinto gods represent important astrological, geographical, and meteorological phenomena which are ever present and considered to affect daily life.\nV. The most important Shinto shrine is the Ise Grand Shrine dedicated to Amaterasu with a secondary shrine to the harvest goddess Toyouke.

{"question":"Topic: Constitutional and Administrative Law.\nQuestion: A woman was employed as a state trooper. Although the state provides both sexes with equal pay and benefits, the state has adopted a policy that prohibits the assignment of female officers to its special undercover narcotics division. This is a moderate risk position that sometimes involves violent encounters with drug dealers. Since the special narcotics division was first established, five undercover agents have been killed in the line of duty. It is because of the state's concern with the safety and well-being of its female officers that it has adopted such a policy. The woman, who desired to be a member of the narcotics division, filed an application for assignment as a special drug agent. After she was rejected for the position, the woman sued the state in federal court to enjoin enforcement of its stated policy on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. As a matter of constitutional law, which of the following results in this suit is most appropriate?\nA) Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest.\nB) Judgment for the woman, because the state's policy constitutes unjustified sex discrimination.\nC) Judgment for the woman, because gender-based discrimination in state employment violates the Equal Protection Clause.\nD) Judgment for the state, because it is within a state's police power to insulate the terms and conditions of governmental employment.\nE) Judgment for the state, because the nature of the position justifies a gender-based classification.\nF) Judgment for the woman, because the terms and conditions of state government employment are privileges or immunities of state citizenship that may not be abridged by the state on the basis of gender.\nG) Judgment for the woman, because the state's policy is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\nH) Both Judgment for the state, because the nature of the position justifies a gender-based classification and Judgment for the state, because the state has articulated a rational basis for this classification and, therefore, a court may not substitute its judgment for that of responsible state officials are correct\nI) Judgment for the state, because the dangerous nature of the work in the narcotics division provides a valid basis for the policy.\nJ) Judgment for the state, because the state has articulated a rational basis for this classification and, therefore, a court may not substitute its judgment for that of responsible state officials.","answers":["A","Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest.","A) Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest."]}

{"question":"Topic: Procedural Law.\nQuestion: The procuratorate received an anonymous report: Wang Mou defrauded a national ecological compensation fund. After investigation, the procuratorate investigators found that Wang Mou had engaged in bribery during the process of obtaining the compensation. To obtain evidence of Wang Mou's crime, the procuratorate temporarily seized the funds under the name of 'recovering illicit gains.' Wang Mou repeatedly reported the situation to higher-level procuratorates and petition departments, demanding the return of the funds, but to no avail.

{"question":"Topic: Logic.\nQuestion: Cotton and linen both readily catch fire. A batch of towels is composed of both cotton and linen, and is known to have caught fire. If it is known that the towels were ignited by a lit cigarette, which of the following arguments utilizes the most appropriate form of reasoning?\nA) Eliminating all other unlikely or improbable causes, such as spontaneous combustion or electrical faults, it is highly probable, given the presence of flammable materials (cotton and linen towels) and an ignition source (lit cigarette), that the cigarette caused the fire.\nB) There was a lit cigarette near flammable towels, and there was a fire involving those same towels. The most likely explanation is that the cigarette caused the towels to ignite, and consequently, the fire. Therefore, the cigarette was the cause of the fire.\nC) Most fires involving fabric materials like towels start from an open flame, like a cigarette. Since the towels are made of cotton and linen, and a lit cigarette was found, the fire most likely originated within the cotton and linen mixture due to the presence of the open flame.\nD) Over 40% of household fires are started by cigarettes, and a lit cigarette was confirmed to be present. Given that the towels are composed of 40% cotton and 40% linen, and it's highly likely a cigarette started the fire, it can be concluded that the fire started in either the cotton or linen portions of the towels.\nE) Towels are made to absorb water, yet cotton and linen are flammable materials. It is therefore inherently risky to have a lit cigarette near cotton\/linen towels, so it is almost certain that the lit cigarette was the cause of the fire.\nF) While not ruling out other less probable sources, the simultaneous presence of a lit cigarette and a pile of towels made of cotton and linen suggests a likely connection between the two. Since most fires in the home are due to easily preventable accidents, it is probable that the cigarette ignited the towels.\nG) Fires require three elements: heat, fuel, and oxygen. The towels, being made of flammable cotton and linen, provided the fuel. The air supplied the oxygen. The lit cigarette supplied the heat. Therefore, the cigarette caused the fire.\nH) Statistically, cigarettes are the leading cause of house fires. Therefore, combined with the known flammable materials present in the towels, the probability that the cigarette was the cause of the fire is very high.\nI) It is common knowledge that cigarettes can start fires. Therefore, since a lit cigarette was near the towels, and those towels are known to be flammable, the fire must have started there due to the presence of the lit cigarette.\nJ) Because a lit cigarette was the only ignition source present near the towels made of combustible cotton and linen, it can be concluded that the cigarette was the cause of the fire.","answers":["J","Because a lit cigarette was the only ignition source present near the towels made of combustible cotton and linen, it can be concluded that the cigarette was the cause of the fire.","J) Because a lit cigarette was the only ignition source present near the towels made of combustible cotton and linen, it can be concluded that the cigarette was the cause of the fire."]}

Although a number of lawyers applied for the position, one of the applicants submitted a particularly impressive resume. The dean of faculty for the law school immediately wrote to the applicant to offer him the position. In the letter, the dean offered to employ the applicant for the upcoming academic year, which started on August 15, at a salary of $75,000$. The letter also listed the employment terms and conditions, one of which stated that professors are entitled to five paid sick days during the year. The dean included a detailed employment contract containing all these terms, for the applicant's signature. After the applicant received this letter, he replied by mail, requesting a salary of $85,000 and sick leave of 10 days. Upon receipt of the applicant's letter, the dean telephoned the applicant and told him that the law school followed the American Bar Association guidelines with respect to salary and sick leave for its professors. The applicant acquiesced on the salary question, but insisted that his sick leave be extended to 10 days. The dean replied, \"Let's not permit a minor issue to stand in the way of your coming to teach at our law school. In the event you require more than 5 sick days, I promise that the matter will be taken care of to your benefit. \" The applicant informed the dean that he would sign the contract and forward it to the dean, which he promptly did. The applicant began teaching at the law school on August 15. Three months later, the applicant was out sick for five days with laryngitis. The applicant did not miss another school day until Monday, March 8, when he fell ill with food poisoning. This illness kept him home for five additional sick days. The applicant returned to work on March 15. When the applicant received his salary check at the end of the week, his check did not include payment for the previous week (from March 8 to March 12). Accompanying the check was a statement that read:\"Salary payment for period from Monday, March 1 through Friday, March 19 with pro rata deduction to reflect five teaching days missed during said period. \"When the applicant received his check, he immediately confronted the dean and requested full payment for the week of March 8 through 12.

{"question":"Topic: French Language and Literature.\nQuestion: Ces dernières années, de nombreuses organisations de défense de l'environnement ont adopté des techniques empruntées au monde de l'espionnage, afin de lutter contre les réseaux de trafic d'espèces protégées qui généraient jusqu'à 20 milliards de dollars de revenus annuels. Conséquence de ce commerce qui se situe au quatrième rang des activités illégales les plus rentables de la planète : l'extinction annoncée d'espèces menacées.\nFace à cette urgence, les méthodes traditionnelles des ONG ne suffisent plus. « Le renseignement est un immense outil potentiel pour stopper la crise environnementale », estime Tim Wittig, spécialiste du trafic illégal d'espèces à l'Institut de Bâle sur la gouvernance.\nSur le terrain, le recours à des méthodes empruntées à l'espionnage est désormais indispensable pour prendre le devant, selon Vincent Opyene, un avocat de 46 ans, dont vingt passés à lutter contre le trafic d'espèces protégées dans son pays, l'Ouganda. Il a fondé en 2013 le NRCN, une ONG qui fait « de l'investigation et du renseignement ». Il est fier d'avoir mis sous les verrous, dans son pays, quelque « 660 trafiquants ».\nL'Afrique de l'Est offre un terrain de jeu idéal à cet espionnage au service des éléphants. D'abord, la région est un haut lieu du braconnage et, donc, du trafic. Dans ces pays en développement, les agences environnementales manquent de moyens, tandis que les renseignements du gouvernement ont d'autres urgences. Pour les anciens des « services », l'offre est tentante. « Il y a là une occasion de faire les choses bien, [...] d'avoir un impact », abonde M. Wittig. Et la combinaison espionnage-braconnage attire l'attention des donateurs.\nSur le terrain, le « renseignement » s'opère différemment. Au Kenya, a été ainsi conduit, entre 2015 et 2019, un programme basé sur un réseau d'informateurs dispersés dans les villages. En Ouganda, le NRCN peut aussi arrêter et mener les poursuites contre des suspects - une compétence que l'État lui a déléguée. Au-delà de la région, certaines organisations se sont même spécialisées dans les investigations transcontinentales.\nAvec le renseignement, l'arme ultime contre le trafic d'animaux a-t-elle enfin été trouvée ? Loin de là, estiment cependant les experts interrogés. Sans la rigueur et la technicité nécessaires à un recueil d'informations crédibles et à une bonne protection des informateurs, les risques sont pourtant grands, car les défenseurs de l'environnement peuvent être des cibles.\nLorsque les enquêtes mènent à des arrestations, il s'agit le plus souvent de petites mains et, dans le cas de plus gros trafiquants, le dossier est souvent abandonné, par négligence ou en raison de la corruption.\nM. Wittig insiste lui aussi sur le manque de professionnalisme : « Il faut s'assurer que ce soit fait dans le respect de la loi. Les ONG doivent absolument travailler sous mandat des autorités. »\nSur la base du texte ci-dessus, répondez aux questions suivantes. Sur la base du texte ci-dessus, répondez aux questions suivantes. Selon le spécialiste Tim Wittig, ______.\nA) les programmes de surveillance en Afrique de l'Est ont échoué à protéger efficacement les espèces menacées\nB) les organisations environnementales doivent cesser d'utiliser des techniques d'espionnage dans leur lutte quotidienne\nC) les systèmes de renseignement actuels sont trop coûteux pour être maintenus par les organisations locales\nD) les méthodes d'espionnage traditionnelles sont inefficaces pour combattre le commerce illégal des espèces menacées\nE) les réseaux d'informateurs locaux sont trop risqués pour être utilisés dans la protection des espèces sauvages\nF) le renseignement est l'arme la plus puissante contre le trafic d'espèces protégées\nG) les anciens des services de renseignements ne sont pas prêts à s'engager dans la lutte contre le trafic d'espèces protégées\nH) les informateurs et les membres des ONG ne courent pas de risques\nI) le professionnalisme fait encore défaut aux ONG quoiqu'elles soient actives\nJ) les autorités gouvernementales devraient être les seules à gérer les opérations contre le trafic d'espèces","answers":["G","les anciens des services de renseignements ne sont pas prêts à s'engager dans la lutte contre le trafic d'espèces protégées","G) les anciens des services de renseignements ne sont pas prêts à s'engager dans la lutte contre le trafic d'espèces protégées"]}

{"question":"Topic: French Language and Literature.\nQuestion: La Banque mondiale ramène ses prévisions de croissance mondiale à 2,4 % pour cette nouvelle année, par rapport aux 2,9 % annoncés en janvier dernier. Cette décision s'explique par les taux de croissance anémiques enregistrés dans les économies avancées, la faiblesse persistante des prix des produits de base, l'atonic du commerce mondial et la diminution des flux de capitaux.\nSelon le dernier rapport sur les perspectives pour l'économie mondiale, parmi les marchés émergents, les pays en développement exportateurs de produits de base ont du mal à s'adapter à la faiblesse des cours du pétrole et d'autres produits essentiels, ce qui explique la moitié de cette révision à la baisse. La marge de progression escomptée dans ces économies est d'à peine 0,4 % cette année, soit 1,2 point de pourcentage de moins que les chiffres annoncés en janvier dernier.\n« Ce ralentissement démontre l'importante nécessité pour les pays d'appliquer des politiques qui favorisent la croissance économique et améliorent les conditions de vie des personnes vivant dans une pauvreté extrême », affirme le président du Groupe de la Banque mondiale, Jim Yong Kim. « La croissance reste le principal déterminant de la réduction de la pauvreté, et c'est la raison pour laquelle nous sommes très inquiets de la voir ralentir brusquement dans les pays en développement exportateurs de produits de base en raison de la faiblesse des prix dans ce secteur. »\nLes économies en développement qui importent des produits de base sont plus résilients que les pays qui en exportent, même si les effets positifs de la baisse des prix des produits énergétiques et d'autres tardent à se matérialiser. Ces marchés et ces économies devraient afficher une croissance de 5,8 % cette année - soit un peu moins que les 5,9 % estimés pour l'année dernière - en raison d'une embellie de l'activité économique favorisée par la faiblesse des prix des produits énergétiques et une légère reprise dans les économies avancées.\nParmi les grandes économies émergentes, la Chine devrait enregistrer un taux de croissance de 6,7 % cette année, contre 6,9 % l'année précédente. L'économie indienne devrait poursuivre sa forte progression à 7,6 %, alors qu'on s'attend à des récessions bien plus marquées au Brésil et en Russie que ne l'indiquaient les chiffres de janvier. L'Afrique du Sud devrait afficher un taux de croissance de 0,6 % cette année, soit 0,8 point de pourcentage de moins qu'annoncé en janvier.\nLe rapport établit que l'augmentation substantielle des crédits du secteur privé - encouragée par la faiblesse des taux d'intérêt et, plus récemment, l'accroissement des besoins financiers - présente des risques potentiels pour plusieurs marchés émergents.Veuillez répondre aux questions suivantes sur la base de ce qui précède : Pourquoi la Banque mondiale est-elle plus pessimiste qu'en janvier dans ses prévisions de croissance mondiale ?\nA) Les exportations mondiales restent stagnantes.\nB) La production industrielle décline globalement.\nC) Les marchés financiers montrent des turbulences.\nD) Le commerce mondial est atonique et les flux de capitaux diminuent.\nE) La dette publique mondiale augmente rapidement.\nF) Les pays émergents connaissent un recul majeur.\nG) Les taux de change subissent des fluctuations.\nH) Les économies avancées sont anémiques.\nI) Les prix des produits de base demeurent faibles.\nJ) Les investissements étrangers sont en forte baisse.","answers":["H","Les économies avancées sont anémiques.","H) Les économies avancées sont anémiques."]}
